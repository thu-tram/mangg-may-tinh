# Introduction to the Internet: Architecture and Protocols

Bản dịch Tiếng Việt đang dịch được tương đối rồi nhé, mà lười quá nên chưa chỉnh hết thôi....


_By [Peyrin Kao](https://peyrin.github.io), based on lectures by [Sylvia Ratnasamy](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/ratnasamy.html), [Rob Shakir](https://rob.sh/), and others._

These are the course notes for [CS 168: Introduction to the Internet](https://cs168.io/) at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/).

Here is the official course description:

<p class="blue">
	This course is an introduction to the Internet architecture. We will focus on the concepts and fundamental design principles that have contributed to the Internet's scalability and robustness and survey the various protocols and algorithms used within this architecture. Topics include layering, addressing, intradomain routing, interdomain routing, reliable delivery, congestion control, and the core protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, IP, DNS, and HTTP) and network technologies (e.g., Ethernet, wireless).
